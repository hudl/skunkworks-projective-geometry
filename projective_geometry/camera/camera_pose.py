        The camera can be shifted to a 3D location [tx, ty, tz], and the image can undergo a 3D rotation.
        The extrinsic matrix E = [R | T] undoes the rotation and shifts everything to the origin of
        coordinates before projecting the 3D world into the image.
        If we have a point p=[x,y,z] in the 3d world, we can transform it to homogeneous coordinates
        ph = [x, y, z, 1]. Before being projected with the intrinsic matrix, it undergoes the transform
        p'= E * ph = (R * p) + T = R * (p - t) = Rc^-1 * (p - t)
        Therefore
        t = -R*T
        Rc = R^-1 = R^T (for orthogonal matrices M^-1=M^T)
        Scipy has a method to retrieve euler angles from rotation matrix. However, there's an ambiguity
        if one of the angles is 90ยบ, known as the Gimbal lock. Scipy has its own mechanism to deal with it,
        but we'll impose our constraint in that case.
        The rotation matrix is given by the equation in
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#General_rotations
        R=Rz(z)Ry(y)Rx(x) =
        | cos(z)cos(y)    cos(z)sin(y)sin(x)-sin(z)cos(x)    cos(z)sin(y)cos(x)+sin(z)sin(x) |
        | cos(z)cos(y)    sin(z)sin(y)sin(x)+cos(z)cos(x)    sin(z)sin(y)cos(x)-cos(z)sin(x) |
        |   -sin(y)              cos(y)sin(x)                         cos(y)cos(x)           |
        We can see the ambiguity from the equation if R[2, 0] = +-1 --> y=+-90, because in that case
        R[0, 0] = R[1, 0] = R[2, 1] = R[2, 2] = 0
        and there are infinite solutions to satisfy the system given by R[[0,1], [1,2]] (R[2, 0]=-sin(y))
        R[0, 1] = -R[2, 0]cos(z)sin(x)-sin(z)cos(x)
        R[0, 2] = -R[2, 0]cos(z)cos(x)+sin(z)sin(x)
        R[1, 1] = -R[2, 0]sin(z)sin(x)+cos(z)cos(x)
        R[1, 2] = -R[2, 0]sin(z)cos(x)-cos(z)sin(x)
        where we can see the first and third eqs are equivalent, and so are the second and fourth.
        The system
        R[0, 1] = -R[2, 0]cos(z)sin(x)-sin(z)cos(x)
        R[0, 2] = -R[2, 0]cos(z)cos(x)+sin(z)sin(x)
        has infinite solutions cus we can simply set x and solve for y.
        Given how broadcast works, it seems reasonable to assume roll is negligible, so we will force
        x=0 and then solve for
        R[0, 1] = -sin(z)
        R[0, 2] = -R[2, 0]cos(z)
        which leads to
        R[0, 1] / R[0, 2] = tg(z) / R[2, 0]  --> z = arctan2( R[0, 1]*R[2, 0], R[0, 2])
        Note:
            The three rotations are given in a global frame of reference (extrinsic), and the order is x->y->z
